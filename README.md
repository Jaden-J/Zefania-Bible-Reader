# Zefania Bible Reader

## About
Zefania Bible Reader is used to display Zefania XML Bibles through XSL transformation in browsers. The Bible reader is not just a reader but can compare different texts simultaneously. Zefania XML Bible markup language is an XML-based language for the description of Biblical texts. Zefania Bible Reader allows you to view those XML files using any modern Browser. The Bible reader uses XSL Transformation to transform the XML Bible into a human viewable html/css based content. You can upload this in your personal website and allow visitors to have instant access a Bible.
